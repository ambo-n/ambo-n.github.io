This is a portfolio website created using HTML/CSS. It aims to showcase the projects I've worked on and provide more information about myself. Within this website, you can find these following information:

    - A little bit about who I am and my resume (will need to be linked)
    - The projects I've worked on
    - A contact form to contact me
    - Further links to LinkedIn and Github if you would like to connect

The wireframes were designed using Figma. The front page contains an 'About Me' link that is easily noticeable to the users which leads to the second webpage dedicated for the about me section. A navigation tab is available in the header so users can easily skip to areas of interest. Links to external sites such as GitHub and LinkedIn are embedded in the social icons which users can click to access the webpage. As I have not worked on any other projects, random images were used as dummies. A contact form with placeholders is used to give the users an option to get in touch.
